# React-Project (FooCoding)

Welcome to my final project for FooCoding!

My project consist in creating an E-commerce platform created 100% with react.

For this project I managed the global state using ReactJs Context, I used Css Modules for Styling and MUI for icons, and I created my own open sourse Mock Up API server which you can find the code in my repositories.

I deployed on Netlify and you can check the link here https://joyful-biscotti-821067.netlify.app/
